# Breast Cancer Classification Web App

This project is a machine learning-based diagnostic tool that classifies breast tumors as **benign** or **malignant**. It aims to assist with early detection of breast cancer, supporting **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Good Health and Well-being**.

---

## Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women worldwide. Early detection is critical for improving survival rates. This tool uses machine learning algorithms trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) dataset to classify tumors based on biopsy features.

Each year, nearly 500,000 women globally are diagnosed with breast cancer ([source: nature.com](https://www.nature.com/)). A reliable predictive model can significantly aid healthcare professionals in early screening, thereby potentially reducing mortality.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) Dataset
- **Content**: 30 numerical features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness).
- **Target**: Diagnosis (Malignant `M` / Benign `B`)
- **Path**: `data/cleaned_breast_cancer.csv`

Data preprocessing steps included:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding target labels
- Normalizing/standardizing features where appropriate

## SDG 3 Alignment

This project contributes to **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being** by:

- Promoting **early detection** through predictive analytics
- Assisting healthcare professionals with **decision support**
- Reducing risk of delayed diagnosis with rapid classification tools

## Ethical Considerations

Medical AI carries important ethical responsibilities:

- Not a diagnostic tool: The app includes a disclaimer stating that predictions are for educational/demonstration purposes only.

- Bias in data: Historical datasets may reflect demographic or procedural biases.

- Model error: All models have false positive and false negative rates‚Äîhuman oversight is essential.

- Transparency: Code and instructions are open-source to promote trust and reproducibility.

- Explainability: Feature importance plots are included to support clinical interpretability.

Sample Outputs

- Confusion Matrix (Random Forest)
  Shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions. A good classifier has high values on the diagonal.

Example image placeholder:

- ROC Curve Comparison (SVM vs. RF)
  Visualizes model performance at different classification thresholds. Area Under Curve (AUC) is a key metric.

Example image placeholder:

- Feature Importances
  Left: Gini importance (from Random Forest)

Right: Permutation importance (shows how model accuracy drops when a feature is shuffled)
